🚀 Phase 3 – ETL Pipeline using PySpark

🔹 Objective:
The objective of this phase is to understand and implement the ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) process using PySpark. The focus is on handling real-world data and building a structured and reliable data pipeline.

🔹 Problem Summary:
In this phase, we worked with multiple datasets such as customers.csv and sales.csv.
The data contained issues like missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistent records.

The goal was to:

* Read and understand raw data
* Clean and validate the data
* Perform transformations
* Generate meaningful business insights

🔹 Approach:

* Extracted data from CSV files using PySpark
* Inspected schema using printSchema() to understand data types
* Cleaned data:

  * Handled null values using dropna() and fillna()
  * Filtered out invalid records
  * Converted data types (e.g., total_amount from string to double)
* Joined datasets using customer_id
* Applied transformations:

  * Aggregations using groupBy()
  * Applied filtering conditions
* Built a pipeline:
  read → clean → filter → join → aggregate → output

🔹 Key Transformations Used:

* read() → Load data
* dropna() / fillna() → Handle missing values
* filter() → Remove invalid data
* withColumn() + cast() → Fix data types
* join() → Combine datasets
* groupBy() + sum() / count() → Aggregations
* row_number() (Window function) → Ranking

🔹 Output / Results:
The following outputs were generated:

* Repeat customers based on order count
* City-wise revenue analysis
* Highest spending customer in each city
* Final reporting table with customer-level metrics

🔹 Data Engineering Considerations:

* Ensured correct data types before aggregation
* Cleaned data before performing joins
* Maintained proper order of operations
* Validated data at each stage of the pipeline

🔹 Challenges Faced:

* Handling null and missing values
* Dealing with incorrect data types from CSV files
* Writing accurate join conditions
* Understanding and applying window functions for ranking

🔹 Learnings:

* Real-world data always requires cleaning before processing
* Importance of schema validation
* How to build a structured ETL pipeline
* Mapping SQL logic to PySpark transformations
* Thinking in terms of end-to-end data pipelines instead of isolated queries

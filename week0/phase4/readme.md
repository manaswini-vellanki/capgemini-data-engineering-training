📊 Phase 4 – Mini Project: Business Pipeline & Analytics

🔹 Objective

Build an end-to-end data pipeline using PySpark to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.

🔹 Project Overview

In this project, we worked with multiple datasets such as customers, orders, and sales. The focus was on performing data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and business analysis.

🔹 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning
Removed null values (e.g., customer_id)
Removed duplicate records
Filtered invalid values (such as negative amounts)
Checked and corrected data types
2. Data Transformation & Analysis

✅ Task 1: Daily Sales

Calculated total sales per day
Output: date, total_sales

✅ Task 2: City-wise Revenue

Calculated total revenue for each city
Output: city, total_revenue

✅ Task 3: Top 5 Customers

Identified top spending customers
Output: customer_name, total_spend

✅ Task 4: Repeat Customers

Found customers with more than one order
Output: customer_id, order_count

✅ Task 5: Customer Segmentation

Categorized customers based on spending:
Gold → > 100
Silver → 50–100
Bronze → < 50
Output: customer_name, total_spend, segment
3. Final Reporting Table
Combined all insights into a single dataset

Output columns:

customer_name
city
total_spend
order_count
segment

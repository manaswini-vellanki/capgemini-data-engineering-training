## 🔹 Objective

In this phase, the goal is to perform data cleaning, transformation, and pattern extraction using PySpark and Regular Expressions (Regex).
The focus is on handling real-world data issues such as inconsistent formats, missing values, and extracting useful patterns from text data.

---

## 🔹 Problem Summary

The datasets used in this phase contained:

- Text data with mixed patterns (alphabets + numbers)
- Columns like email, phone, and IDs that required pattern extraction
- Missing (NULL) values in some fields
- Inconsistent formats in categorical columns

The main tasks were to:

- Clean and standardize the data
- Extract specific patterns using Regular Expressions
- Handle NULL values effectively
- Perform transformations using PySpark DataFrame operations

---

## 🔹 Approach

1. Loaded the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame
2. Inspected the data for inconsistencies and missing values
3. Applied filtering conditions to extract required records
4. Used column transformations to clean and standardize data
5. Applied Regular Expressions to extract patterns from text fields
6. Performed sorting, deduplication, and data enrichment
7. Generated the final structured output

---

## 🔹 Key Transformations Used

### 🔸 Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regex was used to extract patterns from text-based columns such as:

- Extracting numbers from strings
- Identifying patterns at the beginning or end of values
- Extracting parts of emails (username, domain)
- Extracting country codes from phone numbers
- Separating alphabetic and numeric values

Importance:
Regex helps in extracting meaningful patterns from unstructured text data, which is very common in real-world datasets.

---

### 🔸 Data Filtering

- Applied conditions to filter rows based on specific column values
- Used logical operators to combine multiple filters

Importance:
Filtering helps in selecting only relevant data for analysis.

---

### 🔸 Column Transformations

- Renamed columns for better readability
- Created new columns using constant or derived values
- Standardized categorical values

Importance:
Transformations improve data consistency and prepare it for analysis.

---

### 🔸 Conditional Logic

- Applied conditional rules to modify column values
- Categorized data based on specific conditions

Importance:
Helps apply business logic and makes the data more meaningful.

---

### 🔸 NULL Handling

- Identified missing values in columns
- Replaced NULL values with default values

Importance:
Prevents errors during processing and ensures accurate results.

---

### 🔸 Sorting & Deduplication

- Sorted data based on one or more columns
- Removed duplicate records

Importance:
Ensures clean and well-organized data for analysis.

---

### 🔸 Date Functions

- Added current date columns
- Calculated future and past dates

Importance:
Used for time-based tracking and analysis.

---

### 🔸 String Operations

- Standardized text format (case conversion)
- Split columns into structured formats

Importance:
Improves readability and usability of text data.

---

## 🔹 Output / Results

The following outputs were generated:

- Cleaned dataset with consistent formatting
- Extracted patterns such as:
  - Email components
  - Phone number country codes
  - Numeric and alphabetic segments
- Dataset with minimal NULL-related issues
- Sorted and deduplicated data ready for analysis

---

## 🔹 Data Engineering Considerations

- Ensured proper handling of NULL values
- Applied regex carefully to avoid incorrect pattern extraction
- Maintained data consistency after transformations
- Verified outputs after each transformation step

---

## 🔹 Challenges Faced

- Understanding complex regex patterns
- Extracting specific parts of strings accurately
- Handling mixed data types in columns
- Managing NULL values during transformations

---

## 🔹 Learnings

- How Regular Expressions are used for pattern extraction
- Importance of data cleaning in real-world scenarios
- Practical usage of PySpark DataFrame transformations
- Handling missing data effectively
- Applying conditional logic for data standardization

---

## 🔹 Topics Covered

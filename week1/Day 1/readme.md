🚀 Phase 1 – Databricks Interface & Basic Data Cleaning
📌 Objective

The objective of this phase was to understand the Databricks environment and perform basic data cleaning using PySpark on a CSV dataset.

This phase focused on:

Learning the Databricks interface
Working with notebooks and clusters
Performing initial data cleaning tasks
📊 Problem Summary

A small CSV dataset containing inconsistent and dirty data was provided.

The tasks included:

Uploading and reading the dataset in Databricks
Exploring the dataset
Cleaning data by handling nulls, duplicates, and incorrect values
⚙️ Approach
🔹 Environment Setup
Navigated the Databricks workspace
Created and attached a cluster
Uploaded the CSV file to DBFS
🔹 Data Ingestion
Loaded the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame
🔹 Data Exploration
Used .show(), .printSchema(), .describe() for understanding data
🔹 Data Cleaning
Removed null values from critical fields
Handled missing values appropriately
Eliminated duplicate records
Corrected incorrect data types
🔹 Validation
Verified cleaned data using sample checks and summaries
🧠 Databricks Concepts Learned
Workspace → Organizing notebooks and files
Clusters → Compute resources to execute code
Notebooks → Writing and running PySpark code
DBFS (Databricks File System) → Storage layer
DataFrame Display → Interactive data visualization
🛠️ Data Cleaning Techniques Used
dropna() → Remove null values
fillna() → Replace missing values
dropDuplicates() → Remove duplicate records
withColumn() → Modify or clean columns
cast() → Convert data types
filter() → Remove invalid records
📈 Outputs / Results
Cleaned dataset with null values handled
Duplicate records removed
Corrected data types
Improved data quality for downstream processing
🧩 Data Engineering Considerations
Ensured schema correctness using inferSchema
Handled missing values to avoid incorrect analysis
Validated cleaned data using .show() and .describe()
Maintained overall data consistency
⚠️ Challenges Faced
Initial understanding of the Databricks interface
Handling null values effectively
Fixing incorrect data types
Identifying and removing duplicates
🎯 Key Learnings
Fundamentals of the Databricks platform
Working with PySpark DataFrames
Importance of data cleaning in pipelines
Handling real-world messy datasets
Understanding schema inference
🔮 Future Improvements
Add automated validation checks
